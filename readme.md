Math. Lotsa Math, still have a problem with that.  That said, I got this ok enough.  At least I understood it enough

* working with sliders to create an effect
* better emphasis on let
* addEventListener and querySelector (and querySelectorAll) are now commonplace in my undersatanding of JS
* Wes's CSS here is legit (I'm also starting to work on CSS animations too )
